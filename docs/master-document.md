# ReferOn Master Document

Version: 0.2  
Status: Draft  
Last updated: 2026-06-18  
Owner: ReferOn product and engineering

## 1. Purpose

ReferOn is a proof-of-concept web application for creating medical referrals from a patient's latest medical chart history. The POC demonstrates how AI can reduce referral preparation effort, suggest the likely specialty required, and help route the referral to a nearby available specialist.

The POC is designed for hackathon demonstration to non-technical investors, physicians, and faculty. It is not production clinical software. It uses synthetic or de-identified demonstration data, and it does not diagnose, independently order care, or replace physician judgment.

## 2. Product Goals

- Reduce administrative effort required to create complete specialist referrals.
- Use recent chart history to suggest the most relevant specialist type.
- Show a physician/admin-facing manual trigger for referral creation.
- Show a simple specialist self-registration flow.
- Match referrals to nearby specialists using specialty, geography, and availability.
- Tell a clear demo story: chart review to AI suggestion to referral draft to matched specialist.

## 3. POC Strategy

### 3.1 POC Hypothesis

Physicians and clinic administrators lose time converting chart history into specialist referrals and finding appropriate specialists. A focused referral assistant can make that workflow visibly faster and more complete, creating business value even before deep EMR integration, identity management, and production security hardening exist.

### 3.2 Demo Narrative

1. A physician opens a preloaded patient chart.
2. The physician clicks a manual "Create Referral" trigger.
3. ReferOn summarizes the latest relevant chart history.
4. AI predicts the likely specialty and explains why.
5. ReferOn drafts a referral letter/package.
6. ReferOn displays nearby available specialists on a map/list.
7. The physician selects a specialist and sees a ready-to-send referral preview.

### 3.3 POC Success Criteria

- Viewers understand the business pain within the first minute.
- The demo shows a referral draft created from chart history in under 30 seconds.
- The AI specialty recommendation is explainable with references to chart snippets.
- The specialist match view makes geography and availability obvious.
- Specialist self-registration is simple enough to demonstrate live.
- The team can clearly explain what is real, mocked, and planned next.

## 4. Scope

## 5. Demo Personas

These are demo personas, not production security roles.

| Persona | Description | Demo Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Physician | Clinician evaluating a patient chart | Trigger AI referral, review draft, choose specialist |
| Clinic Admin | Office staff preparing referrals | Start manual referral and prepare package preview |
| Specialist | External specialist or clinic representative | Self-register and publish availability/location |
| Demo Operator | Person presenting the POC | Switch between demo views and reset seed data |

## 6. Core Workflows

### 6.1 AI-Assisted Referral Creation

1. Demo user selects a seeded patient.
2. User triggers "Create referral from latest chart."
3. System reads the patient's latest relevant seeded chart history.
4. AI service predicts the required specialty and produces:
   - predicted specialty,
   - confidence score,
   - rationale,
   - source chart references,
   - missing information warnings.
5. System drafts a referral package.
6. User reviews and optionally edits the draft.
7. User selects a specialist from ranked matches.
8. System displays a ready-to-send referral preview.

### 6.2 Manual Referral Trigger

1. Demo user starts a referral manually.
2. User selects patient, reason for referral, preferred specialty, urgency, and notes.
3. System may optionally enrich the draft from chart history.
4. Matching proceeds through the same specialist ranking view.

### 6.3 Specialist Self-Registration

1. Specialist opens registration page.
2. Specialist submits name, clinic, specialty, location, contact, referral criteria, and availability.
3. System creates a demo specialist profile.
4. Profile becomes visible in the demo matching directory.

### 6.4 Specialist Matching

1. System receives referral specialty, patient location, urgency, constraints, and optional preferences.
2. System filters specialists by:
   - specialty and subspecialty,
   - accepting-new-referrals flag,
   - availability window.
3. System ranks candidates by:
   - distance from patient,
   - next available appointment or intake capacity,
   - specialty fit.

## 12. AI Design Notes

### 12.1 AI Responsibilities

- Classify likely specialty or subspecialty.
- Draft referral summary sections from cited chart entries.
- Identify missing information that may block referral acceptance.
- Suggest urgency only as decision support with explicit review requirement.

### 12.2 POC Guardrails

- Require source references for clinical claims.
- Refuse unsupported clinical assertions.
- Keep generated text editable and visibly marked as AI-assisted until reviewed.
- Use synthetic or de-identified chart content only.
- Include confidence thresholds for review emphasis:
  - high: 0.80 and above,
  - medium: 0.50 to 0.79,
  - low: below 0.50 requiring manual specialty selection.

### 12.3 Evaluation

- Build a small synthetic or de-identified test set of referral scenarios.
- Track top-1 and top-3 specialty accuracy.
- Track unsafe or unsupported generated statements.
- Review model performance by specialty class to detect blind spots.

## 13. Future Security and Privacy Model

Security, privacy, and identity are intentionally deferred from the hackathon POC so the team can demonstrate business value first. They remain mandatory for any pilot or production use.

Future implementation must include:

- Authentication through an established identity provider.
- Organization accounts and role-based access control.
- Patient-context authorization checks.
- Append-only audit logs for clinical actions.
- PHI redaction from application logs.
- Managed secret storage.
- AI provider configuration that prevents patient data retention for provider training unless explicitly permitted.
- MFA for production internal users.
- Data retention, consent, and privacy policy controls.

## 14. Test Methodology

### 14.1 POC Test Pyramid

- Unit tests for matching logic, referral state transitions, and AI adapter parsing.
- Integration tests for API endpoints, demo data persistence, seeded chart retrieval, and geospatial search.
- Contract tests for AI adapter response schema and distance/matching responses.
- End-to-end tests for the demo path: patient selection, referral creation, AI prediction, specialist registration, and matching.

### 14.2 Clinical Safety Testing

- Golden-case referral scenarios with expected specialty outputs.
- Adversarial chart entries with ambiguous or conflicting symptoms.
- Missing-data scenarios where the system must warn instead of overconfidently generating.
- Human review checklist for AI-generated referral drafts.

### 14.3 Acceptance Criteria for POC

- A demo physician can create a referral draft from seeded chart history.
- A demo admin can manually create a referral draft.
- AI prediction returns specialty, confidence, rationale, and source references.
- A specialist can self-register and appear in the demo directory.
- Specialists can be ranked by specialty fit, distance, and availability.
- The referral preview is compelling enough to show business value.
- Manual workflow remains usable when AI service is unavailable or mocked.

- Which 2-3 patient scenarios best show the value?
- Should the AI call be live, mocked, or hybrid for demo reliability?
- What geography should the specialist map use?
- What specialist taxonomy should be canonical?
- What distance metric should be used initially: straight-line distance, driving distance, or travel time?
- Should availability be self-reported, integrated from calendars, or manually managed?
- Which production controls should be shown as future roadmap items in the UI?

## 17. Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-06-18 | Use document-driven development with this master document as the initial source of truth. | Align product, architecture, APIs, and tests before implementation starts. |
| 2026-06-18 | Treat AI as clinician-facing decision support, not autonomous clinical decision-making. | Preserve clinical accountability and reduce safety risk. |
| 2026-06-18 | Scope the first build as a hackathon POC rather than production MVP. | Focus the demo on business value and product clarity. |
| 2026-06-18 | Defer user identity, RBAC, production security, and audit logging. | These are critical for production but would distract from the first proof of value. |
| 2026-06-18 | Use seeded synthetic or de-identified chart data for the POC. | Avoid privacy risk while keeping the demo realistic. |

## 18. Document Maintenance Rules

- Update this document when requirements, API contracts, architecture, data model, or test methodology materially change.
- Add ADRs for decisions that are too detailed or contentious for the decision log.
- Keep diagrams current with implemented architecture.
- Link implementation tickets or pull requests back to relevant sections when possible.
- Prefer small, reviewed updates over large stale rewrites.
