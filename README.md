# ReferOn

> AI-assisted specialist referral platform for Ontario healthcare: reducing wait times, cutting administrative overhead, and getting patients to the right specialist faster.

---

## What It Does

Specialist referrals in Ontario are slow, manual, and error-prone. Physicians spend significant time writing referral letters, fax-blasting specialist offices, and chasing status updates — time that could be spent on patient care.

**ReferOn** addresses this by:

- **Parsing clinical notes** — AI extracts the relevant clinical context from a patient's chart
- **Matching to the right specialist** — suggests appropriate specialists based on condition, geography, and wait times
- **Drafting referral letters** — generates structured, complete referral letters ready for physician review
- **Tracking status** — gives referring physicians visibility into where a referral stands

## Why It Matters

Ontario's specialist referral system is largely fax-based and fragmented. Patients wait weeks for referrals to even be processed before waiting months to be seen. ReferOn targets the administrative bottleneck — the time between a physician deciding a referral is needed and a specialist receiving a complete, actionable request — and uses AI to compress it from days to minutes.
